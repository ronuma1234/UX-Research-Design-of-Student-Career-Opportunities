# Human-Computer Interaction Project

 Abstract

The interim group project involved active participation from all members, with each conducting interviews with five individuals. The collective data from 30 interviews resulted in comprehensive insights, including participant quotes, codes, and individual empathy maps. The objective was to gain an unbiased perspective from students on their thoughts and emotions regarding job searches.
The project focuses on supporting students in their search for jobs, internships, or volunteering opportunities. Subsequently, themes and empathy maps were constructed to enhance our understanding of intricate details in students' personal statements and the emotions they experience during this crucial phase of their lives.
